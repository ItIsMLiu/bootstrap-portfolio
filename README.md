Portfolio Showcase: Web Page Crafted with Bootstrap.

## Description 

This bootstrap-portfolio project was created to exhibit my proficiency in website development, serving as a comprehensive showcase of my skills for prospective employers. It contains essential details including my name, photo, bio, portfolio, and contact information.

The HTML and CSS files were created from scratch, incorporating my newly acquired expertise in utilizing Bootstrap. Below, I've highlighted the integration of these skills within the project:
- Adding essential bootstrap css link, popper and JS codes into html 5 doctype file.
- Incorporating custom CSS stylesheet to modify Bootstrap components, loaded second after the essential Bootstrap stylesheet. This setup enables the project stylesheet to override Bootstrap classes, permitting the application of different styles to the same class in the customisation.
- Using and manipulating Bootstrap components including: Navigation bar, hero section created using jumbotron.
- Using bootstrap solution to minimise the use of media queries.

If you wish to review a specific section without having to scroll through the entire page, simply utilise the navigation bar located at the top right corner. From there, select one of the four options: 'Work', 'Skills', 'About/Contact' or 'CV' by clicking on your choice. Within the 'Work' dropdown menu, you can select the specific project for review. This will promptly take you to the desired section on the webpage, where you can delve into the section contents.

This webpage is compatible with various screen sizes, as its layout will automatically respond and adapt.

In the work section, when the project image is clicked, it will take you to the deployed project website or the associated project GitHub repository.
